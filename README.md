---

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

### 1. Inconsistent Advisory Quality & Compliance Risk

* Agents spend up to 20% of their time manually checking AIA’s **Financial Health Rules (FHR)**, **product suitability guidelines**, and **regulatory disclosures**.
* Free-text client notes and justifications are **unstructured and unreviewed**, increasing risk of omissions or misstatements.

### 2. Slow Turnaround & Poor Customer Experience

* Manual completeness checks and follow-ups delay the **quote-to-close cycle by 1–2 days**.
* Clients receive non-uniform recommendations, leading to **eroded trust and satisfaction**.

### 3. Scalability & Training Bottlenecks

* New agents require extensive one-on-one coaching on compliance and suitability, **slowing down distribution growth**.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

CompliSense AI introduces a **multi-layered AI orchestration** framework combining Natural Language Processing (NLP), Rule-Based Engines, and Knowledge Graphs to continuously validate financial advice against AIA’s standards.

### 1. **Automated Rule Compliance Analysis**

* Instantly detect deviations from **Financial Health Rules** and internal guidelines.
* Generate **explainable recommendations** for corrective actions using AI reasoning traces.
* Example: *“Income-to-premium ratio exceeds affordability threshold; consider product X instead of Y.”*

### 2. **Free-Text Compliance Intelligence**

* Parse agent-written justifications and client dialogues to check for:

  * Missing disclosures (e.g., risk tolerance not stated)
  * Misaligned rationale (“client is risk averse” vs “recommended high-risk equity product”)
  * Potential mis-selling patterns
* Auto-summarize client intent + advisor recommendation → compliance alignment score.

### 3. **Scorecard Lapse Detection**

* Continuously monitor gaps in **BSC (Balance Scorecard)** and trigger proactive compliance nudges.
* Examples: “Missing client signature,” “Incomplete fact-find form,” or “Product mismatch in FHR section.”

### 4. **Product Suitability & Affordability Validation**

* Cross-reference client profiles (income, dependents, risk appetite) with product rules and AIA guidelines.
* Suggest alternative product mixes if affordability or suitability mismatches are found.

## 🧩 Expanded Core Use Cases

### **1. FHR Rule Compliance Validation**

**Agent Challenge:** Agents manually cross-check 15-20 Financial Health Rules while filling FHR forms, prone to missing critical thresholds like income-to-premium ratios or emergency fund adequacy.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Real-Time Validation:** As agents enter client income ($4,500/month), the AI instantly calculates if the proposed premium ($1,800/month = 40% of income) exceeds the 25-30% affordability threshold.
- **Smart Alerts:** Pop-up notifications: *"⚠️ Premium ratio too high. Suggested max premium: $1,350. Consider reducing coverage or extending term."*
- **Rule Citation:** Shows exact rule reference from AIA's Advisory Manual (e.g., "Section 3.2.1: Premium should not exceed 30% of monthly income").
- **Alternative Suggestions:** Recommends compliant product combinations that achieve similar coverage within budget.

**AI Capability:** Rules engine + LLM for deviation summary + database of 200+ FHR rules

---

### **2. Free-Text Advisory Notes Intelligence**

**Agent Challenge:** Agents write subjective justifications like *"Client wants investment growth"* without capturing risk appetite details, leading to suitability gaps.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Semantic Analysis:** Detects contradictions—if notes say *"client is conservative"* but recommended product is *"high-risk equity fund"*, AI flags the mismatch.
- **Missing Information Detection:** Identifies gaps like "No mention of client's investment horizon" or "Risk tolerance not explicitly stated."
- **Quality Scoring:** Rates justification completeness (0-100%) with specific improvement suggestions: *"Add why client needs liquidity in 5 years"* or *"Clarify if client understands capital loss risk."*
- **Template Suggestions:** Offers compliant phrasing examples: *"Client acknowledges moderate risk appetite (score 6/10) and accepts potential 15-20% volatility for long-term growth over 15 years."*

**AI Capability:** LLM fine-tuned on 50,000+ AIA advisory notes + compliance annotation dataset

---

### **3. Scorecard Lapse Detection & Auto-Completion**

**Agent Challenge:** BSC (Balance Scorecard) has 45+ checkpoints; agents often miss required fields like client signatures, fact-find sections, or disclosure acknowledgments.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Progressive Validation:** Tracks completion status in real-time: *"Section 2B (Dependent Details): 60% complete. Missing 2 children's education cost estimates."*
- **Mandatory Field Enforcement:** Prevents form submission if critical fields are blank with contextual prompts: *"Client signature required on page 3 before proceeding."*
- **Smart Pre-Fill:** Suggests data from previous client interactions: *"Last year's emergency fund was $15,000. Would you like to carry forward this value?"*
- **Audit Trail:** Maintains version history of all form changes with timestamps for compliance review.

**AI Capability:** ML-based completeness predictor trained on 100,000+ submitted forms + rule-based validation engine

---

### **4. Product Suitability & Affordability Matching**

**Agent Challenge:** Matching 200+ AIA products to individual client profiles (age, income, dependents, risk appetite, goals) is mentally taxing and error-prone.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Intelligent Product Filtering:** For a 35-year-old with 2 kids, $5,000/month income, and moderate risk tolerance, AI instantly shortlists 8 suitable products from the catalog.
- **Affordability Calculator:** Shows visual breakdown: *"Proposed premium $1,200/month = 24% of income ✓ | Emergency fund coverage: 6 months ✓ | Remaining discretionary income: $2,300 ✓"*
- **Life Stage Alignment:** Validates product fit: *"Term life insurance recommended ✓ Aligns with client's protection priority during child-raising years."*
- **Scenario Modeling:** Lets agents test "What if income drops to $4,000?" to ensure resilience against life changes.

**AI Capability:** Hybrid rules engine (product eligibility criteria) + embedding similarity models (client-product matching) + Monte Carlo simulations

---

### **5. Compliance Graph Engine for Risk Pattern Detection**

**Agent Challenge:** No visibility into broader compliance patterns—agents can't see if their recommendations align with best practices or if they're creating risky patterns.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Relationship Mapping:** Creates knowledge graph linking Client → Profile → FHR Data → Recommended Products → Compliance Rules → Agent History.
- **Pattern Queries:** Agents can ask: *"Show me all my recommendations for clients aged 55-65 in the last quarter"* to self-audit for age-biased selling.
- **Supervisor Insights:** Managers query: *"Which agents repeatedly violate affordability ratios?"* or *"Are high-net-worth clients getting diversified portfolios?"*
- **Trend Analysis:** Identifies systemic issues: *"30% of lapsed policies had premium ratios >35%. Strengthen affordability checks."*

**AI Capability:** Neo4j knowledge graph + Graph Neural Networks for link prediction + SPARQL-like query interface

---

### **6. Real-Time Compliance Copilot (Conversational AI)**

**Agent Challenge:** During client meetings, agents need instant answers to compliance questions but can't search through 500-page manuals.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Chat Interface in FHR Form:** Agent types: *"Can I recommend ILP to a 68-year-old?"* → AI responds: *"⚠️ Not recommended. MAS guidelines suggest lower-risk products for clients >65. Consider 'RetireSecure Plus' instead."*
- **Contextual Help:** If agent is filling Section 4 (Protection Needs), copilot proactively suggests: *"Tip: For clients with young children, consider adding critical illness riders."*
- **Citation Mode:** Every answer includes source: *"According to AIA Advisory Manual v2.3, Section 7.4..."* with clickable link to full document.
- **Multi-Turn Dialogue:** Agent: *"What if the client insists on ILP?"* → AI: *"Document explicit acknowledgment of higher risk and obtain signed waiver. Use disclosure template FRM-203."*

**AI Capability:** LLM with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) over AIA compliance knowledge base + conversational memory

---

### **7. Adaptive Learning Engine**

**Agent Challenge:** New regulations (e.g., MAS updates on investment-linked policies) require manual retraining, causing delayed compliance.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Continuous Learning:** Every supervisor approval/rejection feeds back into the model. If 80% of "high-premium recommendations for low-income clients" get rejected, AI learns to flag similar cases proactively.
- **Regulatory Auto-Updates:** When MAS publishes new guidelines (e.g., enhanced disclosure requirements), AI ingests the document, updates validation rules, and notifies agents: *"New Rule Effective 1-Jan-2026: All ILP proposals require 5-year cost projection."*
- **Personalized Agent Coaching:** Tracks individual agent weaknesses: *"John tends to under-document risk disclaimers. Suggested training: Module 12 - Risk Communication."*

**AI Capability:** Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) + NLP pipeline for regulatory document parsing + agent-specific performance models

---

### **8. RegTech API Suite for Seamless Integration**

**Agent Challenge:** Compliance checks happen in isolation—data silos between LeadMate (CRM), iPoS (proposal system), and FHR forms cause duplication and errors.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Unified Compliance Layer:** APIs like `/api/compliance/check` validate proposals from any system (mobile app, web portal, third-party tools).
- **Premium Calculation API:** `/api/premium/calc` returns real-time premiums with compliance metadata: `{"premium": 1200, "affordability_ratio": 0.24, "status": "compliant"}`.
- **Document Review Endpoint:** `/api/doc/review` accepts uploaded FHR PDFs, runs OCR + validation, and returns: *"Missing client signature on page 3. Risk appetite section incomplete."*
- **Webhook Notifications:** When a proposal is flagged high-risk, system auto-notifies supervisor via Slack/Teams.

**AI Capability:** REST APIs with OpenAPI specs + webhook architecture + microservices for scalability

---

### **9. Behavioral Analytics & Early Warning System**

**Agent Challenge:** Agents unknowingly develop bad habits (e.g., consistently recommending high-commission products) until flagged during audits.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Behavioral Scoring:** Tracks metrics like "Average premium-to-income ratio," "Frequency of high-risk product recommendations," "Client complaint correlation."
- **Anomaly Detection:** If an agent's average premium ratio suddenly jumps from 22% to 38% in one month, system alerts: *"⚠️ Unusual pattern detected. Review required."*
- **Predictive Compliance Risk:** Before submission, AI assigns risk score: *"This proposal has 73% similarity to historically rejected cases. Reasons: High premium ratio + vague justification."*
- **Benchmark Comparison:** Shows agent how they compare to peers: *"Your FHR approval rate (78%) is below team average (89%). Focus area: Better documentation of client needs."*

**AI Capability:** Time-series anomaly detection (Isolation Forest) + classification models trained on approved/rejected proposals + peer comparison analytics

---

### **10. Client-Facing Transparency Features**

**Agent Challenge:** Clients often don't understand why specific products were recommended, leading to trust issues and delayed decisions.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Auto-Generated Suitability Report:** After agent completes FHR, AI creates a 2-page client-friendly summary: *"Based on your income ($5,000), family size (4), and moderate risk appetite, we recommend Term Life + Savings Plan. This ensures $500,000 protection while building $80,000 education fund over 15 years."*
- **Interactive Comparison Tool:** Clients see side-by-side comparison of 3 recommended products with visual charts showing: Premium vs Coverage, Risk Level, Maturity Value Projections.
- **Confidence Score Display:** *"This recommendation matches your profile at 92% confidence based on 10,000 similar successful cases."*
- **Plain Language Translations:** Converts jargon like "Sum Assured" → "Amount your family receives if something happens to you."

**AI Capability:** Natural Language Generation (GPT-based) + data visualization libraries + confidence scoring from historical data

---

### **11. Multi-Language & Voice Processing**

**Agent Challenge:** Singapore's multilingual environment (Singlish, Mandarin, Malay, Tamil) makes text-based notes inconsistent; phone call insights are lost.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Multilingual Note Processing:** AI understands mixed-language notes: *"Client say lah, he want保险 (insurance) for his anak (children)."* → Extracts: *"Client wants insurance for children."*
- **Voice Meeting Analysis:** Agents record client meetings; AI transcribes and auto-fills FHR sections: *"Detected from audio: Client mentioned RM3,000 monthly income, 2 children aged 5 and 8, concerned about education costs."*
- **Compliance Red Flags from Audio:** Flags problematic statements: *"⚠️ At 12:35, agent said 'guaranteed returns'—this violates disclosure rules. Use 'projected returns' instead."*
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Detects client hesitation: *"Client tone suggests uncertainty about premium affordability. Consider follow-up conversation."*

**AI Capability:** Multilingual NLP (mBERT, XLM-R) + Speech-to-text (Whisper) + sentiment analysis models

---

### **12. Gamification for Agent Excellence**

**Agent Challenge:** Compliance feels like a chore; agents lack motivation to improve documentation quality beyond minimum standards.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Compliance Leaderboard:** Weekly ranking: *"Top 10 agents with 98%+ first-submission approval rates win 'Gold Compliance Badge' and recognition in team meetings."*
- **Achievement System:** Unlock badges: *"Perfectionist" (10 consecutive error-free submissions), *"Client Champion" (5-star suitability scores for 20 clients).*
- **Skill Challenges:** Monthly scenarios: *"Challenge: Review this high-net-worth client profile and recommend optimal product mix. Top 3 solutions win prizes."*
- **Training Fast-Track:** Agents maintaining 95%+ compliance scores get accelerated certification for complex products (e.g., trusts, investment portfolios).

**AI Capability:** Scoring algorithms + gamification engine + performance tracking dashboard

---

### **13. Regulatory Intelligence Hub**

**Agent Challenge:** MAS and AIA policy updates are buried in lengthy PDFs; agents miss critical changes until audit failures.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Auto-Ingestion of MAS Updates:** AI monitors MAS website, extracts key changes from new circulars, and pushes notifications: *"🔔 New Disclosure Rule (MAS Notice 302-A): Effective 1-Mar-2026, include projected vs guaranteed values comparison in all ILP proposals."*
- **Change Impact Analysis:** AI maps new rules to affected products: *"This update impacts 23 AIA products. Updated compliance checklist available in FHR form Section 5."*

**AI Capability:** Web scraping + NLP for regulatory document parsing + blockchain ledger (Hyperledger) + compliance analytics

---

### **14. Advanced Document Intelligence**

**Agent Challenge:** Clients submit handwritten payslips, bank statements with typos; manual data entry is error-prone and time-consuming.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Intelligent OCR:** Extracts data from photos of documents: Payslip → Monthly Salary: $4,850 | CPF Contributions: $725 → Auto-fills FHR income section.
- **Cross-Validation:** Compares declared income ($5,000) vs extracted payslip data ($4,850) → Flags: *"⚠️ Income mismatch. Verify with client."*
- **Signature Compliance Check:** Ensures e-signatures match biometric standards and verifies client physically signed all 7 required disclosure pages.
- **Version Control:** Tracks every document upload: *"Client uploaded payslip v1 (15-Dec-2025), v2 (17-Dec-2025). System used latest version for validation."*

**AI Capability:** Computer vision (OCR with Tesseract/Google Vision API) + signature verification algorithms + document versioning system

---

### **15. Collaborative Supervisor Oversight**

**Agent Challenge:** Supervisors manually review 50+ proposals daily, spending 15-20 minutes per case without prioritization logic.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **AI-Prioritized Queue:** Supervisors see risk-ranked list: *"High Risk (3 cases): Premium ratio >40% | Medium Risk (12 cases): Vague justifications | Low Risk (35 cases): All checks passed."*
- **Bulk Review Interface:** Approve 10 low-risk cases in 2 clicks; focus time on 3 high-risk cases requiring deep review.
- **Second Opinion Mode:** AI provides independent assessment alongside supervisor review: *"AI Recommendation: Reject (78% confidence). Reasons: Missing emergency fund details, product misaligned with age."*
- **Auto-Generated Feedback:** When rejecting, AI suggests specific feedback: *"Return to agent with comment: 'Add client's monthly expenses breakdown and recalculate discretionary income.'"*

**AI Capability:** Multi-document ranking algorithms + risk scoring ML models + NLG for feedback generation

---

### **16. Client Journey Continuity**

**Agent Challenge:** Agents don't know if clients already have 3 other AIA policies; recommendations might create over-insurance or coverage gaps.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Portfolio Health Check:** AI scans client's existing policies: *"Client has $300,000 term life + $50,000 critical illness. New proposal adds $200,000 term → Total coverage $500,000 = 100x monthly income ✓ (within recommended 50-150x range)."*
- **Gap Analysis:** Identifies missing protection: *"⚠️ Client has no hospitalization coverage despite having 2 young children. Suggest H&S rider."*
- **Life Event Triggers:** When client updates profile (married → new child), AI proactively suggests: *"Client had baby 3 months ago. Review life insurance adequacy—current coverage may be insufficient."*
- **Cross-Policy Consistency:** Flags contradictions: *"Client declared non-smoker in Policy A but smoker in current application. Verify status."*

**AI Capability:** Customer data platform integration + rules engine for coverage adequacy + life event detection ML

---

### **17. Embedded Ethical AI Safeguards**

**Agent Challenge:** Unconscious bias might lead to different recommendations for clients of different genders/ethnicities with identical profiles.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Fairness Audit Dashboard:** Analyzes 10,000 proposals to detect bias: *"Male clients aged 30-40 receive ILP recommendations 42% more often than female clients with identical risk profiles. Investigation required."*
- **Explainability Layer:** Every AI decision shows reasoning: *"Recommendation: Reject. Factors: Premium ratio (35% weight), Missing disclosures (25%), Product mismatch (20%), Agent history (20%)."* Uses LIME/SHAP visualizations.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Override:** If AI flags a case but supervisor disagrees (with strong justification), they can override and system learns: *"Note: Supervisor approved high premium ratio due to client's bonus-heavy income structure. Update affordability rules to consider irregular income."*
- **Ethics Board Review:** Quarterly reports on AI decisions sent to governance committee for bias monitoring.

**AI Capability:** Bias detection algorithms (Fairness Indicators) + LIME/SHAP explainability tools + human feedback loops + audit logging

---

### **18. Ecosystem Integration Expansion**

**Agent Challenge:** Client information scattered across LeadMate (CRM), email threads, WhatsApp chats, paper forms—agents waste time piecing together context.

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **CRM Auto-Enrichment:** After FHR submission, AI pushes compliance insights back to LeadMate: *"Client risk profile: Moderate | Compliance score: 94% | Approved products: Term Life, Savings Plan."*
- **Email/WhatsApp Mining:** AI scans communication history for undeclared information: *"In WhatsApp chat on 10-Dec, client mentioned 'planning to buy house next year'—add to financial goals section."*
- **Calendar Intelligence:** Suggests optimal follow-up timing: *"Client's FHR incomplete (missing spouse income). Best follow-up window: Tue-Thu 2-5pm based on past response patterns."*
- **Unified Client View:** Single dashboard showing: Last meeting notes + Email sentiment + Compliance status + Outstanding tasks.

**AI Capability:** API integrations (Salesforce, Outlook, WhatsApp Business) + text mining + sentiment analysis + workflow automation

---

- **Cross-Border Expansion:** Adapts to regional regulations: *"Switching to Malaysia mode → Loaded Bank Negara guidelines + Shariah compliance rules for Takaful products."*

**AI Capability:** GANs for synthetic data generation + simulation frameworks + multi-jurisdiction rule engines

---

### **20. Revenue-Linked Intelligence**

**Agent Challenge:** Agents struggle to maximize client value while staying compliant—either too conservative (low premiums) or too aggressive (rejection risk).

**How CompliSense AI Helps:**
- **Premium Optimization:** For a client with $1,500 affordable premium, AI suggests optimal mix: *"Recommendation: $800 term life + $400 savings plan + $300 H&S = $1,500 total. This maximizes protection (92% efficiency) while maintaining 30% affordability ratio."*
- **Retention Risk Scoring:** Identifies policies likely to lapse: *"⚠️ Client's premium ratio increased from 22% to 34% after job change. High lapse risk (78%). Suggest premium holiday option."*
- **Upsell/Cross-Sell Compliance:** When suggesting additional products, validates total burden: *"Client has existing $600/month premium. Proposed additional $400 → Total $1,000 = 20% of income ✓ Safe to proceed."*
- **Lifetime Value Optimization:** Balances short-term revenue with long-term retention: *"Lower premium plan ($800 vs $1,000) has 15% higher 10-year retention rate → $96,000 total premiums vs $84,000. Recommend lower premium."*

**AI Capability:** Optimization algorithms (linear programming) + churn prediction models + lifetime value modeling + affordability constraints

## 🛡️ MoneySense Guardrails Integration

CompliSense AI embeds Singapore Government's **MoneySense guidelines** as foundational compliance rules, ensuring every recommendation aligns with national financial planning standards before customers buy policies.

### **Core MoneySense Rules Enforced by CompliSense AI**

| MoneySense Guideline | Rule Implementation in CompliSense AI | Agent Experience |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Insurance Spending: Max 15% of income** | Hard validation rule that flags proposals where total premiums exceed 15% | ⚠️ *"Total premium ($750) = 16% of client income ($4,500). MoneySense recommends max 15% ($675). Reduce coverage or extend term."* |
| **Death/TPD Coverage: 9x annual income** | Calculates required coverage based on client income and flags under/over-insurance | ✓ *"Client income $60,000/year → Recommended coverage $540,000. Current proposal $500,000 is 92% adequate. Consider topping up $40,000."* |
| **Critical Illness Coverage: 4x annual income** | Validates CI coverage adequacy against income benchmarks | ⚠️ *"Client income $72,000/year → Recommended CI coverage $288,000. Current proposal $150,000 covers only 52%. Suggest CI rider or standalone plan."* |
| **Emergency Fund: 3-6 months expenses** | Cross-checks if client has sufficient liquidity before committing to insurance premiums | 🟡 *"Client has $8,000 emergency fund for $3,000/month expenses = 2.67 months coverage. Below MoneySense 3-month minimum. Prioritize building emergency fund before increasing premiums."* |
| **Retirement Savings: Min 10% of income** | Ensures insurance premiums don't crowd out retirement savings | ⚠️ *"Client allocates 8% to retirement + 15% to insurance = 23% total. This leaves insufficient for MoneySense-recommended 10% retirement savings. Rebalance allocation."* |

---

### **Life Stage-Specific Validation**

CompliSense AI applies **age-appropriate guidelines** based on MoneySense life stage frameworks:

#### **Fresh Entrants (19-29 years)**
- **Priority Check:** Protection before investment products
- **Validation:** *"Client is 24 years old. MoneySense recommends term life + hospitalization before investment-linked policies. Flag ILP proposal as not age-appropriate."*
- **Affordability Focus:** Lower premium tolerance (10-12% of income) due to lower earning power

#### **Starting a Family (25-34 years)**
- **Dependent Protection Check:** Validates coverage includes spouse + children needs
- **Validation:** *"Client has 2 children aged 3 and 5. Recommended coverage includes: Income replacement (9x income) + Education fund ($100,000 per child) + Mortgage protection. Current proposal covers only income replacement—add education savings component."*
- **Liquidity Warning:** Ensures emergency fund covers 6 months (not 3) due to family responsibilities

#### **Supporting Aged Parents (35-59 years)**
- **Multi-Generational Check:** Validates coverage accounts for elderly parent medical costs
- **Validation:** *"Client supports 2 parents aged 68 and 72. MoneySense recommends setting aside $500-800/month for parent healthcare. Current disposable income after premium ($1,200) insufficient. Reduce premium to $1,000."*
- **Sandwich Generation Alert:** Flags over-commitment when supporting both children and parents

#### **Pre-Retirees (55-64 years)**
- **Risk Profile Shift:** Blocks high-risk products; recommends reducing protection, increasing savings
- **Validation:** *"Client is 58 years old. MoneySense guidelines suggest shifting from term life to retirement income products. Proposed 20-year term extends beyond retirement age—recommend 10-year term or whole life with reduced coverage."*
- **CPF Optimization:** Suggests strategies to maximize CPF LIFE payouts

#### **Golden Years (65+ years)**
- **Protection Wind-Down:** Validates that premiums don't deplete retirement funds
- **Validation:** *"Client is 67 years old with $300,000 retirement savings. Proposed $400/month premium = $96,000 over 20 years = 32% of total savings. MoneySense recommends max 10% of retirement funds for insurance. Reject proposal."*
- **Healthcare Focus:** Prioritizes MediShield Life supplementation over new life insurance

**Example Client Suitability Report:**
```
Dear Mr. Tan,

Based on your financial profile and Singapore Government's MoneySense
guidelines, here's why we recommend the following:

1. PROTECTION COVERAGE
   Your annual income: $60,000
   MoneySense recommended coverage: $540,000 (9x income)
   Our proposal: Term Life $500,000 + CI $240,000

   ✓ Meets MoneySense death protection standard
   ⚠️ CI coverage is $48,000 below recommended $288,000 (4x income)
   → Consider adding CI Top-Up Rider for full protection

2. AFFORDABILITY CHECK
   Your monthly income: $5,000
   Total premium: $650/month (13% of income)
   MoneySense guideline: Maximum 15%

   ✓ Well within safe affordability zone
   ✓ Leaves $850/month for retirement savings (17% of income)

3. EMERGENCY FUND STATUS
   Your current savings: $18,000
   Monthly expenses: $3,200
   Coverage: 5.6 months

   ✓ Exceeds MoneySense 3-6 month recommendation

Would you like me to **expand this into a PRD-style document** (with sections like Vision, Goals, Success Metrics, User Journeys, and Architecture Diagram)?
That would make it ready for submission to the AIA Innovation Council.
