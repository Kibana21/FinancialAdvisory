## ❌ The Critical Problems We Solve

### 1. ⏰ Compliance Bottleneck Crisis
**Current Reality:** Manual compliance checks take 2+ days per proposal. Supervisors spend 8.75 hours daily reviewing proposals manually. This creates massive delays in customer service and agent productivity.

### 2. 🚫 Human Error Epidemic
**Risk Impact:** 35% of proposals fail initial compliance checks due to human error. Agents struggle with 50+ MoneySense rules. This leads to regulatory penalties and customer dissatisfaction.

### 3. 📊 Scalability Nightmare
**Growth Constraint:** Current manual process cannot scale with business growth. Adding more supervisors is expensive and still error-prone. Digital transformation is essential for competitive advantage.

### 4. 💸 Revenue Leakage
**Business Cost:** Delayed approvals = lost sales opportunities. Compliance errors = regulatory fines. Agent frustration = higher turnover costs. Time spent on paperwork ≠ time with customers.

### 🎯 The Core Challenge
AIA Singapore processes thousands of financial advisory proposals monthly. Each must comply with MoneySense guidelines, but manual validation is slow, error-prone, and doesn't scale. **We need intelligent automation that maintains regulatory excellence while dramatically improving efficiency.**
